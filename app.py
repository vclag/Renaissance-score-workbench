"""
RENAISSANCE POLYPHONY RESEARCH TOOLKIT -- a small Streamlit web app that
aggregates ~4,300 pieces across 7 Renaissance-polyphony sources (a
music21-bundled corpus, CRIM Project, Josquin Research Project, 1520s
Project, Tasso in Music Project, SEILS, Lassus's Geistliche Psalmen)
into one browsable, searchable place, then runs CRIM Intervals'
structural analyses (cadences, points of imitation, homorhythm) and
writes the results back onto the score itself, plots them across the
piece, or exports them as data. Started as a single-purpose "Cadence
Annotator" (see git history/earlier commit messages for that phase),
then "Renaissance Score Workbench" once the collection-aggregation side
grew into something worth naming on its own; renamed again once cadence
annotation stopped being the single headline feature among several.

Everything below runs in a single process, in the `crim` conda env (same
env that runs crim_export_cadences.py / annotate_cadences.py on the
command line -- see those files' docstrings for why one env is enough
here). Streamlit re-runs this whole script top-to-bottom on every user
interaction (button click, dropdown change, etc.) -- that's normal for
Streamlit, not a bug; it's why there's no explicit event-loop code below.

# whatever THIS piece's own file actually says is the only reliable
# option). Codes below checked directly against two real collections
# before choosing them, not guessed from the Humdrum reference-record
# spec alone: music21's bundled Palestrina files carry YOR/YOO (the
# original PRINT edition this encoding derives from, and its publisher --
# e.g. "Le Opere Complete, v. 18, p. 126" / "Rome, Italy: Fratelli

# while JRP's carry SCA (the modern CRITICAL edition name itself, e.g.
# "New Josquin Edition 3.1") -- genuinely different fields for genuinely
# different kinds of source information, and neither collection has both.
#
# humdrum:RNB was tried here and removed: despite the generic Humdrum
# label, this corpus's own files actually use it for something entirely
# different -- a "Cadence finals: D" (or, on a real piece checked
# directly, "Cadence finals: G,C,A") summary, not a note about the
# SOURCE at all. Showing it as an "Editorial note" here was actively
# misleading, not just off-topic -- this exact field's meaning is

# polyphonic setting), so it doesn't belong in a "where does this

    optionally runs each of CRIM's three structural analyses on it and
    writes whichever ones are requested onto the score. Returns
    (annotated_score, stats, error).

    include_cadences=True (the default, preserving this app's original
    behavior) runs CRIM cadence detection (voice_detail=True, for the
    PartMap this tool relies on -- see crim_export_cadences.py's
    docstring) and hands off to annotate_score() for the actual
    labeling/coloring. Set it False to skip cadences entirely -- e.g. to
    get only points-of-imitation/homorhythm, or, with all three flags
    False, a completely unmodified score for a plain download with zero
    CRIM computation at all.

    include_ptypes=True additionally runs presentationTypes() (points of
    imitation -- PEN/ID/FUGA) and marks those on the same score too, in a
    different color (see annotate_presentation_types); its stats are
    folded into the same dict under 'ptypes_labeled'/'ptypes_colored',
    only when this flag is set, so callers that never asked for it don't
    need to know the keys exist.

    include_homorhythm=True likewise runs homorhythm() (chordal, shared-
    text-declamation passages) and marks those too (see
    annotate_homorhythm), folding stats in under 'hr_labeled'/'hr_colored'.
    Unlike cadences()/presentationTypes(), homorhythm() returns a bare
    None (not an empty DataFrame) when nothing is found -- checked
    directly in its own source before relying on this -- so that's
    checked for explicitly rather than assumed away.

    section_boundaries: the (offset, title) list corpus_sources.parse_
    music21_piece() returns for a merged multi-part Palestrina movement
    (None for a single-file piece, or anything from a non-music21
    source) -- when given, this marks the original section boundaries
    (see annotate_movement_sections) BEFORE any of the three analyses
    above, and unconditionally (stats['section_labeled']), regardless of
    which include_* flags are set -- source structure, not an optional
    analysis result, so it shows even on a plain unannotated download.

    error is None unless cadence detection itself failed (see
    _safe_cadences) -- ptypes/homorhythm are individually guarded too (a
    crash in either just skips that one optional feature -- see the
    'ptypes_failed'/'hr_failed' stats keys -- rather than losing an
    otherwise-successful annotation over it). Barring that error,
    annotated_score is never None -- if nothing was requested, or
    everything requested came up empty, the caller still gets a score
    back (unmodified in the former case) plus a stats dict that's empty
    or missing the relevant keys; show_result() reads that to decide
    what to tell the user, rather than this function refusing to return

    level (confirmed real, correct `<measure-style><multiple-rest>`
    output, real page-count reduction: Josquin's 24-voice "Qui habitat
    in adjutorio altissimi" dropped from 50 to 37 Verovio-rendered
    pages, -26%) -- but wiring it into every export triggered a
    SEVERE, reproducible Verovio rendering crash: `[Error] Staff @n=
    'X' for rendering control event tie ... not found`, hanging/
    killing the native renderer before it finishes a single page.
    Reproduced on a normal, previously-solid 5-voice Palestrina piece
    (Agnus_00), not just the extreme canon that prompted this -- a
    systemic risk across the corpus, not an isolated edge case. Root
    cause not found: the generated MusicXML is standard and correct
    (checked directly), so this looks like a genuine bug in Verovio's
    own C++ tie-rendering path when it interacts with a compressed
    rest run nearby, not a mistake in this function's own output --
    but that's not independently confirmed against Verovio's own
    source, just the most likely explanation given what was checked.
    Reverted from the live pipeline for safety; kept here, unused, as
    a working implementation for whoever picks this back up -- fix (or
    at least isolate/avoid) the tie interaction before ever wiring this
    back in.

    Consecutive whole-measure rests in one voice get collapsed into a
    single 'N measures rest' notation symbol -- standard, universal
    engraving practice (any real notation program respects it; this is
    NOT a Verovio-only trick) via music21's own `spanner.
    MultiMeasureRest`, which `m21ToXml.py` already translates into
    MusicXML's own `<measure-style><multiple-rest>` element -- confirmed
    directly, not assumed, against Verovio's own renderer too: an
    isolated test (5 consecutive whole rests + 1 real note in one part)
    rendered as 2 visual measures instead of 6, with a genuine
    'multiRest' element present in the output SVG.

    Prompted by a user question ("qui habitat wouldn't be so many pages
    [if silent voices didn't draw blank measures]" -- a 24-voice canon
    where each of the 6 real-time copies of one melody rests for long
    stretches before its own entry). Two OTHER real approaches were
    tried and rejected first, not skipped over:
    - Verovio's own 'condense' option (the Dorico-style feature for
      merging near-identical DOUBLING instruments onto shared staves) --
      tested directly on this exact piece at every documented value
      ('none'/'auto'/'encoded'): zero effect on page count or per-page
      staff count. A different feature than what was needed here (it
      targets doubling instruments sharing ONE staff, not hiding an
      individual staff's own rest-only stretches), not a bug in how
      this app was calling it.
    - True per-system dynamic staff-hiding (what notation software
      calls "hide empty staves") needs MEI-level <scoreDef>/@visible
      toggling mid-score -- a real mechanism, but MusicXML (this app's
      whole export/import pipeline, all the way to Verovio) has no
      native equivalent, and building one would mean writing MEI
      directly instead of MusicXML -- a much bigger architecture change
      than this fix, not pursued.

    Only collapses a measure that is EXACTLY one whole-measure rest and
    nothing else -- checked via the measure's own direct note/rest
    count (a single Rest, no Note) AND that it carries no Expression
    (TextExpression/RehearsalMark) of its own -- deliberately
    conservative, so this can never swallow a real annotation (e.g. a
    section-boundary RehearsalMark sitting on an otherwise-silent
    measure stays its own un-compressed measure, never hidden inside a
    rest glyph). `min_run=2`: even 2 consecutive rest measures becoming
    one small "2" marking is a real, standard compression, not gated to
    runs of 3+.

    Applied directly to the SAME score object both "Download
    MusicXML"/"Download annotated MusicXML" and the PDF export use --
    unlike _strip_phantom_verse_text, this loses nothing (every
    <measure> stays in the file; MultiMeasureRest only changes how a
    compliant reader DRAWS them), so there's no reason to keep it
    PDF-only or gate it on voice count -- it's a pure improvement for
    ANY piece with 2+ consecutive rest measures in any one voice, run
    unconditionally on every export, not a user-facing toggle.

    (the page title is the clearest example: <text font-size="0px"> with

    position only from the outer <text> tag and silently defaults to
    (0, 0) when it isn't there -- confirmed by inspecting the resulting

    left edge of the page, not a genuine layout/centering bug in Verovio

    (the <text> itself, or its first positioned descendant <tspan>) onto
    the <text> element directly. Also drops each <title> sub-element's

    elsewhere (see render_preview_and_annotate's docstring); defaults to
    filename_stem itself when the caller doesn't have a more specific one
    (e.g. the Upload tab, where only one instance ever exists).

    filename_stem itself stays the piece's own raw machine ID -- it's
    reused below to build result_key/pdf_cache_key, which need to stay
    exactly as unique as before (see this file's own git history for why
    a shared cache key across different pieces was a real, confirmed
    bug). download_name is what actually appears in the downloaded
    file's name -- defaults to filename_stem, but every caller with a
    richer label available passes _rich_filename_stem(label, filename_stem)
    instead, so a bulk ZIP's own file listing identifies each piece
    (composer, mass/collection title, movement) without needing to
    cross-reference back to the search that produced it -- the Upload
    tab (no such label to build one from) is the one caller that doesn't.

    corpus_matches -- Browse's own `matches` list ([(label, collection,
    native_ref), ...]), passed through ONLY by the Browse tab (every
    other caller leaves it None): when given (and longer than one
    piece), the pattern-search expander below shows a second button to
    search the SAME query across every match, not just this one piece

Each label is `<CadType> → <Tone>` -- the kind of cadence, and which
pitch class it resolves to (or the lowest sounding pitch, if the tone
itself was evaded -- see the CVF table below).

**Cadence types** CRIM recognizes (a realized type may also appear
prefixed `Evaded` or `Abandoned` when the expected voice-leading doesn't
fully complete): Authentic, Phrygian, Leaping Contratenor, Clausula Vera,
Phrygian Clausula Vera, Altizans Only, Phrygian Altizans, Double Leading
Tone, Quince, Reinterpreted. (Quince is rare, mostly in thicker textures
with a 5th voice; Reinterpreted is rarer still, where a pair of voices
that first sounds like a Cantizans-Bassizans pair gets reinterpreted
mid-cadence into an Altizans-Quintizans pair instead.)

**CVFs (Cadential Voice Functions)** -- the short code like `CTB` or
`Tcu` next to each cadence in the raw data names which voice performed
which contrapuntal role, in top-to-bottom staff order. **Uppercase =
fully realized, lowercase = evaded/abandoned.**

| Letter | Role | Motion |
|---|---|---|
| `C` | Cantizans | up a step (the "leading tone" voice) |
| `T` | Tenorizans | down a step |
| `B` | Bassizans | up a 4th / down a 5th |
| `A` | Altizans | like Cantizans, but resolves a 5th above the Tenorizans instead of an octave |
| `L` | Leaping Contratenor | up an octave at the arrival |
| `P` | Plagal Bassizans | up a 5th / down a 4th |
| `Q` | Quintizans | resolves a 4th below the Cantizans' goal tone (or an octave below the Altizans') |
| `S` | Sestizans | down a 3rd (thicker textures) |
| `c` | Cantizans, evaded | moves to an unexpected note at the arrival |
| `t` | Tenorizans, evaded | goes up a step instead of down |
| `b` | Bassizans, evaded | goes up a step instead of its expected leap |
| `u` | Bassizans, evaded | goes down a 3rd instead |
| `s` | Sestizans, evaded | resolves down a 2nd instead of a 3rd |
| `x` | Bassizans, abandoned | the voice drops out at the arrival |
| `y` | Cantizans, abandoned | the voice drops out at the arrival |
| `z` | Tenorizans, abandoned | the voice drops out at the arrival |

So e.g. `Tcu` (an example straight from Agnus_00's own output): the
Tenorizans resolves normally, but the Cantizans lands somewhere
unexpected and the Bassizans drops a 3rd instead of leaping -- a cadence
CRIM detected the shape of, but that doesn't fully "land," which is why
rows like this often have a blank CadType (no complete standard pattern
matched) rather than one of the named types above.

**How it finds them:** it doesn't look at the full chord at once -- it
looks at **pairs of voices**, and tracks two things between each pair
over time: the harmonic interval separating them (3rd, 5th, octave,
...) and each voice's own melodic motion (step up, step down, leap, by
how much). A cadence, contrapuntally, is really a small number of
well-known two-voice interval progressions -- e.g. a major 6th
expanding to an octave (a classic Cantizans-Tenorizans pair), or a
major 3rd contracting to a unison. CRIM has a table of these named
two-voice patterns (`CVFLabels.csv`, inside the library itself) and
scans **every pair of voices** in the piece for a match, at every point
in time.

**Why it needs at least 2 voices in the file, but works fine on a
2-voice passage inside a bigger piece:** with only 1 voice there's no
pair to compare at all -- there's no "other voice" to measure an
interval against, so nothing can ever match. But a passage where only 2
of a piece's, say, 4 voices happen to be sounding (the others resting)
works completely normally -- that's not a special case, it's the exact
situation the whole method is built around. (This is also the real
reason the two music21-bundled composers left out of the Composer
dropdown above don't work here: their files are a single monophonic
voice, full stop -- not "a 2-voice passage," genuinely no second voice
to pair with, ever.)

**References** -- neither the categories above nor the detection method
are this app's own invention, or even CRIM's: the CVF names/roles are
reproduced from [CRIM Intervals' own
documentation](https://github.com/HCDigitalScholarship/intervals)
(`ImportedPiece.cadences`/`.cvfs` docstrings), so this stays accurate if
CRIM's own definitions change -- but CRIM itself is applying an
existing musicological framework, not one it invented:
- The Cantizans/Tenorizans/Bassizans/Altizans names are Bernhard Meier's
  own Latin coinages for these voice-leading roles: Bernhard Meier, *Die
  Tonarten der klassischen Vokalpolyphonie* (Utrecht: A. Oosthoek, 1974);
  trans. Ellen S. Beebe, rev. by the author, as *The Modes of Classical
  Vocal Polyphony: Described According to the Sources* (New York: Broude
  Brothers, 1988).
- The systematic classification into named cadence types (Authentic,
  Phrygian, Clausula Vera, etc.), and this pairwise interval-progression
  detection method itself, are documented in Alexander Morgan, Daniel
  Russo-Batterham, and Richard Freedman, ["Musicologists and Data Scientists

This is a separate feature from cadences -- turn it on with the "Mark
points of imitation" checkbox next to Analyze/Download. It runs CRIM's
`presentationTypes()`, which finds **where a melodic idea (a "soggetto")
enters in one voice and is then imitated by others** -- the other
hallmark structural feature of this repertoire, alongside cadences.

**How it finds them:** it looks at each voice's melodic line and marks
"entries" -- a short run of notes (4 by default) that starts right after
a rest, a fermata, or a section break, since that's where a new
melodic idea is most likely to be freshly stated. It then checks every
other voice for a similar run of notes (allowing for transposition, and
optionally a little melodic "flex") appearing at a *later* offset. A
group of two or more such matching entries across different voices,
close enough together in time, becomes one "presentation type" instance.

**The three labels you'll see** -- CRIM classifies each instance by the
*pattern of time gaps* between successive entries (checked directly in
its source -- there's no fuller plain-language definition in CRIM's own
documentation beyond this, so this reflects what the code actually does,
not an assumption). The label on the score uses plain language, not
CRIM's own short codes (shown here in parentheses only for anyone
cross-referencing CRIM's own tools/output):
- **Point of Entry** (CRIM's code: `PEN`) -- every entry is spaced from
  the next by the *exact same* time interval -- a strict,
  regularly-staggered entry.
- **Imitative Duo** (`ID`) -- a smaller, odd-numbered, alternating group
  of entries -- typically two voices trading a short motive back and
  forth.
- **Imitative Entry** (`FUGA`) -- everything else -- the general case,
  most often several voices (3+) each taking up the same subject one
  after another, less strictly regular than a Point of Entry. CRIM's own
  code name uses the 16th-century sense of the Latin/Italian word
  "fuga" (voices "fleeing" one after another) -- deliberately not shown
  on the score itself, since to a modern eye it reads as a claim about
  the later, much stricter Baroque fugue, which this isn't.

**What actually appears on the score:** the note where each voice's
entry begins is colored **blue** (cadences are red, so both survive on
one file together), and the *first* entry of each instance gets a text
label naming its type (e.g. `Imitative Entry`), placed above the top staff at that
same beat -- same placement convention as cadence labels, so it always
reads cleanly above the system regardless of which voice enters first.

**References** -- "presentation types" and this specific three-way split

A third, separate feature -- turn it on with the "Mark homorhythmic
passages" checkbox next to Analyze/Download. It runs CRIM's `homorhythm()`,
which finds **passages where two or more voices move together in the
same rhythm while singing the same words** -- a chordal, declamatory
texture, as opposed to the independent, staggered melodic lines that
cadences and points of imitation are both built around. This is the
other main way this repertoire varies its texture: strict counterpoint
punctuated by moments where the voices briefly line up and declaim text
together, often at a structurally important line of the text.

**How it finds them:** it looks at short runs of notes (4 by default) in
every voice at once, two ways in parallel -- matching **rhythm**
(each voice's own sequence of note durations) and matching **lyrics**
(each voice singing the same syllables at the same time) -- and keeps
only the passages where both line up across two or more voices that are
actually sounding (not resting). By default it requires *every* active
voice to match, not just some of them, for a passage to count.

**When there's no text underlay at all:** some sources encoded in this
tool (confirmed on the music21-bundled Palestrina corpus) have no lyrics
attached to the notes whatsoever -- CRIM's `homorhythm()` then reports
zero passages for every single piece from that source, regardless of
how rhythmically homophonic the music actually is, since it can never
pass the lyrics half of the check. This is a real, disclosed limitation
of the underlying method on that kind of source, not a bug in this
app -- a rhythm-only fallback was tried here and removed again (it
didn't hold up well enough in practice), so a lyrics-less piece simply
won't show any homorhythm results at all, rather than a weaker
approximation under the same label.

**What actually appears on the score:** every note belonging to a
matching passage is colored **green** (cadences are red, points of
imitation are blue, so all three survive on one file together), and one
`Homorhythm` text label marks the start of each passage. Cadence labels
sit above the top staff, points-of-imitation labels above the bottom
staff, and homorhythm labels below the bottom staff -- three different
staff/placement combinations (not just three vertical offsets on the
same staff) so the three categories stay visually separate even when
they land at the same moment in the piece.

**Reference:** unlike cadences (Meier) or presentation types (Schubert),
"homorhythm" itself isn't a single scholar's coinage -- it's standard,
widely-used musicological terminology for chordal, same-rhythm textures,
so there's no one naming source to point to the way the other two
expanders do. CRIM's own rhythm+lyrics n-gram method for detecting it
computationally is part of the same project documented in Richard
Freedman and David Fiala, ["Citations: The Renaissance Imitation Mass

### What this app actually uses

**Cadence detection & typology** (the CVF names, cadence type labels,
and the pairwise-interval detection method itself):
- Bernhard Meier, *Die Tonarten der klassischen Vokalpolyphonie*
  (Utrecht: A. Oosthoek, 1974); trans. Ellen S. Beebe, rev. by the
  author, as *[The Modes of Classical Vocal Polyphony: Described
  According to the
  Sources](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3121670W/The_modes_of_classical_vocal_polyphony)*
  (New York: Broude Brothers, 1988).

  (Music Encoding Conference, Halifax, Canada, 2022).

**Points of imitation / presentation types** (the Point of
Entry/Imitative Duo/Fuga terminology and classification):
- Peter N. Schubert, *Modal Counterpoint, Renaissance Style* (New York:
  Oxford University Press, 1999).
- Julie E. Cumming and Peter Schubert, "The Origins of Pervasive
  Imitation," in *The Cambridge History of Fifteenth-Century Music*,
  ed. Anna Maria Busse Berger and Jesse Rodin (Cambridge: Cambridge
  University Press, 2015), chapter 12.

**Homorhythm & the CRIM Project itself:**
- Richard Freedman and David Fiala, ["Citations: The Renaissance
  Imitation Mass Project
  (CRIM)"](https://online.ucpress.edu/jams/article/77/3/863/203475/Citations-The-Renaissance-Imitation-Mass-Project),
  *Journal of the American Musicological Society* 77, no. 3 (2024):
  863-875.

**Melodic pattern search** (the "Find this melodic pattern elsewhere"
expander -- transposition-invariant exact/approximate matching):
- David Garfinkle, Claire Arthur, Peter Schubert, Julie Cumming, and
  Ichiro Fujinaga, ["PatternFinder: Content-Based Music Retrieval with
  music21"](https://doi.org/10.1145/3144749.3144751), in *Proceedings
  of the 4th International Workshop on Digital Libraries for
  Musicology* (DLFM'17, Shanghai, China, 2017), 4 pages -- only its P1/
  P2 algorithms are used here (both independently verified working; a
  real feasibility spike found the other five described in the paper
  currently share an unresolved bug -- see this app's own
  `pattern_search.py` module docstring).

**Modal theory & the Browse tab's Modal family filter** (why it groups
by family rather than showing a raw finalis pitch, why Tritus carries
its own caveat, and how a piece with a flat in its key signature gets
reclassified):
- Heinrich Glarean, *Dodecachordon* (Basel, 1547) -- the primary source
  for the 12-mode system this filter's 6 families are drawn from
  (the 4 traditional finals plus Glarean's own added Ionian/Aeolian).
- Harold S. Powers, ["Tonal Types and Modal Categories in Renaissance
  Polyphony"](https://doi.org/10.1525/jams.1981.34.3.03a00030),
  *Journal of the American Musicological Society* 34, no. 3 (1981):
  428-470 -- the primary source for this filter's cantus durus/cantus
  mollis transposition handling (a piece with a flat in the signature
  gets reclassified to the family it actually sounds like, not the one
  its bare finalis alone would suggest). Powers' own "tonal type" is
  three markers (system + cleffing + final), not the two (system +
  final) this filter uses -- cited here, and in the code's own
  comments, specifically because that gap was checked against this
  source rather than left unexamined: Powers cites Siegfried
  Hermelink's *Dispositiones modorum* (Tutzing, 1960) -- an etic study
  of Palestrina's (and Lasso's) own tonal types, not independently
  read here, only as quoted in Powers -- classifying a cantus-mollis,
  G-final Palestrina piece as "Hypodorian" (transposed up a fourth
  from D), the same reclassification this filter makes.
- Daniel C. Tompkins, ["A Cluster Analysis for Mode Identification in
  Early Music
  Genres"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-71827-9_24),
  in *Mathematics and Computation in Music* (MCM 2017), Lecture Notes
  in Computer Science, vol. 10527 (Cham: Springer, 2017) -- ran on this
  same music21-bundled Palestrina corpus; the specific finding behind
  the Tritus/F-final caveat.
- Margaret Bent, "Musica Recta and Musica Ficta," *Musica Disciplina*
  26 (1972): 73-100 (no DOI for the original article found via
  Crossref; a 2013 reprint exists as a book chapter, DOI
  `10.4324/9780203055588-8`), and Margaret Bent,
  ["Diatonic Ficta"](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0261127900000413), *Early
  Music History* 4 (1984): 1-48 -- why some finals (D/G/A) rely on a
  performer-supplied, usually-unnotated raised leading tone at cadences
  and others (C/E) don't; the mechanism behind why the modal-family
  filter's D+mollis-\>Aeolian mapping carries a lower-confidence caveat
  of its own (see that mapping's own code comment) than the G/F cases.

  imitation, and homorhythmic passage this app marks comes from calling
  its `cadences()`/`presentationTypes()`/`homorhythm()` directly, not a

  for Computer-Aided Musicology and Symbolic Music
  Data"](https://www.music21.org/) (2010) -- every score this app reads
  is parsed with it.

  Ichiro Fujinaga, ["PatternFinder: Content-Based Music Retrieval with
  music21"](https://doi.org/10.1145/3144749.3144751), *Proceedings of
  the 4th International Workshop on Digital Libraries for Musicology*
  (DLfM 2017, Shanghai, China): 5-8 -- the "Find this melodic pattern
  elsewhere" search (single-piece and cross-piece) calls its P1/P2
  algorithms directly; see the pattern-search expander's own caption
  for why only those two of the paper's algorithms are exposed.

### Further reading -- computational musicology & Renaissance polyphony, more broadly

computational/statistical methods to this same repertoire (most of it
to Palestrina specifically), for anyone using this app as part of
broader research into the field. Grouped by what each one actually
does, the same way the section above is.

  *International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial
  Intelligence* (June 2023) -- uses the BIDE sequence-mining algorithm
  to automatically find rhetorical figures (epizeuxis, palilogy, synonymia, polyptoton)
  in Victoria's Masses, reaching 98.1% recall against expert human
  annotation (71.7% precision -- most of the "extra" matches turned out
  to be real patterns nested inside ones the human annotators had
  already flagged, not false positives).

**Dissonance treatment & contrapuntal rules:**
- Torsten Anders and Benjamin Inden, ["Machine Learning of Symbolic
  Compositional Rules with Genetic Programming: Dissonance Treatment in
  Palestrina"](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.244), *PeerJ Computer
  Science* 5 (2019): e244 -- labels dissonances in Palestrina's own
  Masses (the same music21-bundled corpus this app uses) with a custom
  algorithm, clusters them into dissonance categories (passing tone,
  suspension, etc.) with DBSCAN, then learns symbolic composition rules
  describing each category's treatment with genetic programming --
  rules expressed as human-readable logic/numeric formulas, not just a
  black-box classifier.
- Andie Sigler, Jon Wild, and Eliot Handelman, ["Schematizing the
  Treatment of Dissonance in 16th-Century
  Counterpoint"](https://archives.ismir.net/ismir2015/paper/000153.pdf),
  *Proceedings of ISMIR 2015*: 645-651 -- automatic annotation and
  database methods build a schema of dissonance treatment across
  nearly 1,000 Mass movements by Palestrina and Victoria, finding 297
  distinct dissonance structures -- suggestive of a large but genuinely
  bounded "composable space" rather than either a fixed rulebook or
  anything-goes.

  (Future Directions of Music Cognition, Ohio State University, Feb.
  2021) -- finds that violations of traditional voice-leading rules
  (e.g. parallel 5ths/octaves) are significantly more frequent at the
  metric-pulse level than the individual-note level -- a methodologically
  important result showing that the choice of analytical unit changes
  the empirical outcome, not just its precision.
- Claire Arthur, ["Vicentino versus Palestrina: A Computational

  compares the contrapuntal rules Vicentino theorized against
  Palestrina's actual practice, finding general agreement but also
  that Vicentino's taxonomy is too rigid to fully describe how
  Palestrina really used it.

  Renaissance"](https://mtosmt.org/issues/mto.13.19.1/mto.13.19.1.schubert_lessoil-daelman.html),
  *Music Theory Online* 19, no. 1 (2013) -- modular analysis (tracking
  recurring contrapuntal combinations) of two Kyrie settings by Lassus

    *I-prefixed instrument conventions -- *IC<class> (e.g. *ICvox) and
    the short mnemonic *I<code> (e.g. *Ibass, which is how Palestrina's
    own files name voices, and which DOES come through correctly, e.g.
    Agnus_00 -> 'Soprano'/'Alto'/'Tenor'/'Tenor'/'Bass') -- but NOT
    Humdrum's own "printed instrument name" convention, *I"<name> (e.g.
    *I"Bassus6). Confirmed by reading music21's own source directly
    (humdrum/spineParser.py's generic, order-has-to-be-last '*I' branch
    calls humdrum.instruments.fromHumdrumInstrument on *I"Bassus6 the
    exact same way it would on a short code -- that function only ever
    looks the string up in a small abbreviation dict, fails, and the
    caller silently swallows the failure into a no-op MiscTandem, never
    reaching Part.partName at all), not guessed from behavior alone.
    Every part of every piece encoded this way renders as a bare,
    indistinguishable "Voice" -- confirmed directly to be exactly what a
    user flagged, for a real 24-voice piece where it made the PDF
    unreadable (no way to tell which of the 24 identical "Voice" staves
    was which). Checked how widespread this actually is before treating
    it as a one-off: sampled 10 real pieces from each of the 5 GitHub-
    hosted kern collections this app reads (see KERN_COLLECTION_BASE_
    URLS) -- jrp/1520s/tasso/lassus_psalms use *I" for EVERY sampled
    piece (10/10 each, so this isn't a rare edge case, it's closer to
    that whole 4-collection share of the corpus, ~2,558 pieces); seils
    uses it for none (0/10) -- presumably the short-code convention
    music21 already handles, same as Palestrina.

    Reads *I" (and *I', the paired ABBREVIATED name) tokens straight
    from the raw kern text -- a cheap header-only scan, same convention
    already used elsewhere in this project (e.g. corpus_sources.
    _palestrina_key_signature_flats) -- and applies them to the already-
    parsed Score's Part objects, matched by column position via each
    Part's own `.id` (e.g. 'spine_23' -> column 23, 0-indexed from the
    LEFT of the **kern declaration line) rather than by score.parts'
    own iteration order, which is NOT the same thing -- checked directly
    on Agnus_00 (a piece music21 already names correctly) and found
    score.parts lists spine_4 (the file's own RIGHTMOST/5th column)
    first, not spine_0 -- i.e. score.parts iterates in the OPPOSITE
    order from the raw file's left-to-right column order. Using each
    Part's own id sidesteps needing to know or assume that ordering
    rule at all.

    Only overrides a part when a real *I" name was actually found for
    its column -- a column using the short-code convention (which
    music21 already handles correctly, e.g. every Palestrina file) is
    left exactly as music21 produced it, never downgraded."""

    """Works around a real music21 bug (confirmed directly, not just
    suspected -- traced against the raw kern source of Ludwig Senfl's
    "Usquequo Domine", 1520s Project): a genuine mensural PROPORTION
    sign written in Humdrum's own rational-duration "%" syntax inside a
    meter token (e.g. *M3/3%2 -- a sesquialtera/tripla passage, "3%2"
    meaning a triplet whole note per https://humlib.humdrum.org/doc/
    topic/'s own definition of the "%" fraction extension to **kern
    duration) gets parsed by music21 9.9.2's Humdrum importer into a
    nonsensical LITERAL TimeSignature("3/32") instead -- confirmed by
    comparing the raw file's own tandem tokens against music21's parsed
    TimeSignature objects side by side, not assumed from the symptom
    alone. Verovio then faithfully renders whatever bogus signature
    it's handed, fragmenting that passage into a chaotic run of
    tiny measures in the PDF.

    Traced two of music21's own candidate code paths for the actual
    mangling (humdrum.spineParser.kernTandemToObject's own regex, and
    meter.TimeSignature's constructor itself) and confirmed NEITHER is
    ever called while parsing an affected file -- the real responsible
    code path is elsewhere in music21's Humdrum importer, not pinned
    down further here (a music21-internal matter, not this app's own
    code, and chasing it further had rapidly diminishing returns against
    the time spent). This function is a corrective WORKAROUND for the
    visible symptom, not a fix at music21's own root cause.

    Heuristic: any TimeSignature whose denominator exceeds
    _MAX_SANE_TIME_SIGNATURE_DENOMINATOR is replaced with whichever real
    TimeSignature governed the SAME part immediately before it -- i.e.
    treat the corrupted meter change as if it had never happened, not
    as "no time signature at all" (which would just make music21 guess
    again). Verified directly on the Senfl piece that this is musically
    correct, not just visually less broken: every measure in the
    affected passage sums to EXACTLY the restored signature's own total
    duration (8.0 quarterLength under a restored 2/1, in every one of
    the 4 voices) -- strong direct confirmation that the passage really
    is a sesquialtera passage occupying the same total time as the
    surrounding normal measures, exactly what the theory predicts,
    not a coincidence of this one fallback rule happening to avoid a
    crash.

    Deliberately does NOT attempt to reconstruct the historically
    accurate mensural proportion sign (a "3" or circled-3 printed over
    the previous signature) -- that would need correctly re-deriving
    the intended note grouping from the raw kern duration tokens
    themselves, a bigger, riskier undertaking than falling back to the
    previous signature. The note DURATIONS are unaffected either way:
    this bug is in the printed TimeSignature label only -- music21
    reads the individual notes' own "%"-duration tokens (the actual
    triplet rhythm) correctly regardless of which time signature ends
    up grouping them into measures, confirmed by the exact quarterLength
    match above.

    Scope not exhaustively checked: how many OTHER pieces across this
    app's Humdrum-kern collections (1520s Project, JRP, Tasso, SEILS,
    Lassus Psalms) hit this same "%"-in-a-meter-token pattern is not
    known precisely -- this function defends against it wherever it

    de' Belli Occhi Lucenti' showing 'Voices: unknown' where a real
    5-voice madrigal should show 5) -- not something the earlier
    2-sample spot check happened to hit, since both of those samples

# exact G-final/mollis -> Protus mapping used below, independently
# attested for this composer.
#
# Powers' own "tonal type" is explicitly THREE markers, not two --
# system (durus/mollis) + CLEFFING + final -- and this mapping only
# uses two of them, system and final, dropping cleffing. Checked
# whether that's a real gap before shipping it, not assumed away: read
# Powers' own worked examples (his mode-5/6 tables, and the Hermelink
# Hypodorian case above) closely enough to see that where cleffing
# actually varies, its documented role is distinguishing AUTHENTIC from
# PLAGAL within one family (mode 5 vs 6, both still "Lydian") -- a
# finer distinction than this app's own "family, not specific mode"
# scope already declines to make (see this dict's own header comment).
# It is not documented as a signal that moves a piece to a DIFFERENT
# family. Then checked this corpus's own data directly: the soprano
# clef is '*clefG2' in 1316 of 1318 Palestrina pieces (99.8%),
# regardless of flats or finalis -- cleffing is effectively constant
# here, not a second axis this mapping could read even if it tried.
# Caveat, disclosed rather than hidden: that near-total uniformity
# could be a real fact about this repertoire, or could be this
# Humdrum encoding normalizing clefs for legibility rather than
# preserving whatever the original print/manuscript used -- not
# independently checked against the original source, so held open.
#
# Concretely, for the finals this corpus actually uses:
#   G + mollis -> sounds like untransposed D-Dorian    -> Protus
#     (independently attested for Palestrina specifically, above)
#   F + mollis -> sounds like untransposed C-Ionian     -> Ionian
#     (the specific case a user flagged directly: F-final with a flat
#     signature was showing as Tritus/Lydian -- wrong, because the
#     flat removes exactly the raised-4th that DEFINES Lydian, leaving
#     the plain major-scale pattern transposed to F)
#   D + mollis -> sounds like untransposed A-Aeolian    -> Aeolian

# E + mollis is deliberately NOT in this table: its durus-minus-a-
# fourth equivalent is B, and B-final (Locrian) was never a usable mode
# in 16th-century practice (its 5th above the final is diminished, not
# perfect) -- so an E-final piece with a flat doesn't transpose onto
# any real family this way; it's left as plain Deuterus, unreclassified.
# C + mollis is ALSO deliberately not in this table -- see below, this
# was tried and retracted. B-flat-final pieces (the final itself
# already flatted) are a further, rarer case not handled here -- still
# 'nonstandard', same as before.

# **Second, independent cross-check, added 2026-09-03 after a user asked
# "how do I know an unmarked accidental (musica ficta) isn't hiding a
# different mode" for a G-final/no-flat piece.** That question doesn't
# threaten G/no-flat specifically (checked directly on Agnus_00: 45 F
# naturals vs. only 10 F-sharps, all explicitly NOTATED in this corpus's
# own encoding at scattered internal-cadence points, not silently
# assumed diatonic -- i.e. this corpus's transcription does capture
# ficta as real accidentals, at least for this piece) -- but chasing it
# down surfaced something more consequential: 1257 of 1318 Palestrina
# Humdrum files (95.4%) carry their OWN embedded editorial mode tag
# (a '*X:dor/phr/lyd/mix/aeo/ion' reference record in the file header,
# e.g. Agnus_00's is literally '*G:mix') -- an independent editorial
# judgment, not derived from this app's own finalis/cadence computation
# at all, so agreement with it is real corroboration, not circular.
# Cross-checked this app's own (finalis, flats) -> family classification
# against that tag, confident-tier pieces only, 1018 comparable cases:
#   G + 0 flat -> tetrardus:  98.8% agree (240/243)
#   G + 1 flat -> protus:    100.0% agree (183/183) -- the Hermelink-
#     attested case, now doubly confirmed
#   F + 1 flat -> ionian:    100.0% agree (170/170) -- the original
#     bug-report case, fully confirmed
#   D + 0 flat -> protus:     96.5% agree (111/115)
#   A + 0 flat -> aeolian:    91.2% agree (73/80)
#   E + 0 flat -> deuterus:   92.6% agree (87/94)
#   C + 0 flat -> ionian:     89.4% agree (76/85)
#   D + 1 flat -> aeolian:    71.8% agree (28/39) -- real majority
#     support, but the other 28.2% (11/39) tag as 'dor' (still Dorian,
#     untransposed) instead -- kept as the best-supported option, not
#     as settled as G/F.
#   C + 1 flat -> tetrardus:   0.0% agree (0/9) -- ALL 9 tag as 'ion'
#     (Ionian, untransposed), flatly contradicting the textbook
#     transposition arithmetic this mapping was built from. RETRACTED:
#     C is no longer in this table below, so C + mollis now falls
#     through to the plain untransposed 'ionian' -- which is exactly
#     what all 9 tagged pieces actually are. Plausible reason, not
#     independently confirmed: unlike G-Mixolydian (which has a real,
#     documented tritone problem against F that mollis fixes), Ionian's
#     untransposed form has no such problem, so a flat here may just be
#     a customary color choice, not a transposition marker.
#   A + 1 flat -> deuterus: UNTESTED -- only 2 such pieces exist in the
#     whole Palestrina corpus, neither landing in the confident tier
#     with a usable tag. Kept in the table below on pure transposition-
#     arithmetic grounds only (same as C originally was, before being
#     retracted) -- flagged here explicitly as the weakest-grounded
#     entry left, not verified either way.
# This tag's own provenance (Jeppesen's edition vs. the Humdrum
# corpus's own encoder) was not traced independently -- treated as one
# more piece of evidence, not a ground truth.
#
# Verified directly against this corpus before relying on it: checked
# every Palestrina piece's own encoded key signature (0 or 1 flat, no
# sharps, no piece with more than 1 flat -- see corpus_sources.
# _palestrina_key_signature_flats) crossed with its precomputed finalis;
# 459 of 1318 Palestrina pieces (34.8%) carry a 1-flat signature on one
# of these 5 finals and were, before this fix, silently placed in the
# wrong family. Extended to all 7 collections via scripts/augment_key_
# signatures.py (Palestrina's own flats came free from a local file;
# the other 6 needed one raw-content fetch per piece -- Humdrum's
# '*k[...]' line for the 5 kern collections, MEI's 'key.sig="Nf"'
# attribute for CRIM) -- corpus-wide, 1633 of 4267 pieces with a real
# finalis (38.3%) get reclassified by this fix, not just Palestrina's
# own share of it. (This number DROPPED from an earlier 1753/41.1% after
# the C-final retraction above: 120 C+mollis pieces corpus-wide were
# being reclassified to 'tetrardus' on unverified transposition
# arithmetic alone; the embedded-tag cross-check found zero support for
# that and unanimous support for leaving them 'ionian' instead, so
# they're excluded from this count now, not silently still counted.) A
# further ~1.1% of the corpus (49 pieces) carries 2, 3,
# or 4 flats -- genuinely rarer, and NOT handled by this table (falls
# through to the plain untransposed mapping below rather than being
# force-transposed by an unverified further shift); no sharp-signature

    composer is parsed back out of `label` -- safe since it's this app's
    own generated string (see build_browse_index), not third-party data.
    Two different conventions to undo depending on collection: music21
    labels are '[ComposerName] Title' (composer *is* the bracket tag,

    are '[CollectionTag] Composer — Title' (composer follows the tag,

    naming inconsistency across collections (documented at length in
    build_browse_index's git history) isn't a problem here the way it
    was for a filter dropdown -- a CSV column showing both spellings
    as data is just honest, not confusing.

    Two fixes on top of that raw split, both reused from elsewhere in
    this file rather than left half-applied here:
    - lassus_psalms's own labels are just a psalm title with no
      'Composer — Title' prefix at all (see fetch_lassus_psalms_pieces
      -- single-composer collection, nothing to split on), so the
      generic branch below would wrongly treat the whole title as the
      composer -- confirmed directly, e.g. "Beatus vir" ending up as a
      50-row-strong fake "composer". Matches CRIM's own spelling for the
      same person ("Roland de Lassus" -- confirmed against this app's
      real composer data) so the two collections' counts merge instead
      of colliding.
    - A trailing '(YYYY)' (Tasso's own convention, see
      _composer_from_collection_label) is stripped here too -- that
      function only ever ran on the per-collection filter dropdown, not
      this CSV/word-cloud path, so Tasso's composer counts here were
      still fragmenting by publication year (confirmed directly: e.g.
      five separate "Cifra (....)" rows in the real composer-count CSV,
      all the same person). Same regex, same reasoning, just applied
